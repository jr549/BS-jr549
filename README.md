# angular-bootstrap-weather
A web based application that uses angular to display weather information based on zip codes enter by user. 
The data is requested from the Weather Underground site and returns data in the JSON format which is easily parsed using the APIs of AngularJS. 
I also added various images that are customized to display based on the weather description for that area and current conditions.
Bootstrap has also been implemented for display on different devices that have various display areas. This can be recognized by resizing the browser window.
